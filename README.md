# Hearts of Iron Launcher

Launcher for the original Hearts of Iron that allows you to load mods. It should be cloned into /Hearts of Iron/launcher. You can see my HOI1 mod(s) for the descriptor.mod file but it is pretty simple.

Mods should go into Hearts of Iron/mods/, a new directory I made. You have to add a file called descriptor.mod:
```
name=Hearts of Iron
desc=Base Game
base=True
```

Example:
```
name=Kaiserreich for Hearts of Iron
desc=Remake of the legendary Hearts of Iron franchise mod, Kaiserreich, for the first game in the forementioned series.
```
