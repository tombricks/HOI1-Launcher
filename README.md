# Hearts of Iron Launcher

Launcher for the original Hearts of Iron that allows you to load mods. It should be cloned into /Hearts of Iron/launcher. You can see my HOI1 mod(s) for the descriptor.mod file but it is pretty simple.

Example:
```
name=Kaiserreich for Hearts of Iron
desc=Remake of the legendary Hearts of Iron franchise mod, Kaiserreich, for the first game in the forementioned series.
```
